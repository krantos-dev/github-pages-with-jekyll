# Understanding careers in web design and development

- The Web recently celebrated its 31st birthday. Since its founding in 1989 as a single Web server at the CERN Research Institute, the Web has exploded and changed our lives dramatically. Jobs that were imagined are now legitimate career paths with plenty of opportunities and promotions to be had. So how can you get in on this action? Where do you start? How do you transition into it? Is it all so code-ish, or are there jobs for those with less technical skills?

### Front-end or UI (user-interface) careers

- The front end of a website is the customer-facing portion of the site, the part you see when you visit any website. You might be an interaction designer, a UI specialist, a front-end designer, or a front-end developer, or you might just be a web designer. Whatever the name, the front-end specialist typically works with the UX and graphic designers to get a specification for how the front end of a website should look and function. You might program this using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, or you might work on little animations to help further the user experience. You might be involved in some of the prototyping or research work in the interface. However, typically front-end designers and developers are involved at some level with the programming of the website's front end.

### UX (user-experience) careers

- User experience, or UX, is the planning portion of website and application development. User experience professionals often spend their time talking with lots of people. They develop an understanding of what their company or their client wants to accomplish. They identify target audiences, understanding in detail who wants this product, including demographics, psychographic and technical levels. UX professionals also recruit target audience members to participate in user testing, where prototypes are tested to make sure they're effective, meeting established goals for improvement.

### Graphic design careers

- Graphic designers are responsible for the look and feel of all types of products. In the world of applications and websites, graphic designers establish brand elements like logos, typefaces, and colors, and they create beautiful usable websites in the process. Graphic designers for websites and applications work closely with UX professionals to establish an interface. While the UX people make sure that it's usable and page elements are findable, the graphic designers add the right colors and polish to make it beautiful.

### Marketing careers

- Product, price, promotion, place, and people are the five Ps of marketing, and they're at the heart of any type of marketing career. A web marketer is still interested in those five Ps, but they're more into online promotions and selling online, rather than an offline strategy. Traditional marketing concepts are still critically important for a career in web marketing. Those concepts include branding, competitive analysis, developing a value proposition, understanding customers and the customer journey, and combining these concepts into a marketing plan.

# Conclusion

The difference between a web developer and a web designer is bigger than you think. A web designer brings a brand’s idea into an on-screen reality and knows exactly what the specific audience will enjoy. A web developer builds the site’s core structure, using coding languages to construct logical, programmatic websites. However, you need both to get the best experience. It is up to you to decide which career suits you the most
